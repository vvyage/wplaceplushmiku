# A Project to put Miku on the map!
## I made this page to show what I'm trying to paint, and I'd really appreciate your help â€” yes, yours!

How do I contribute?
------------------
To get Miku onto your Wplace page and starting painting, follow the instructions over here to get the browser extension for the template: [https://github.com/SwingTheVine/Wplace-BlueMarble/]
### Warning: Firefox might be buggy since you might have to refresh the Wplace page everytime you place a pixel. (Might just be a issue on my end)


Next, click on the picture of Miku below and right click it to download it and upload it to the blue box on Wplace with these coordinates: 

1163 / 602 / 943 / 171
