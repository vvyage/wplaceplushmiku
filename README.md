# Artwork of Miku!
## I made this page to show what I'm trying to paint, and I'd really appreciate your help!

## This is a *fairly* big project, approx. 621,792 pixels in total. But with enough time we can do it!

# Here's How You Can Help!

---

To get Miku onto your Wplace page and starting painting, follow the instructions over here to get the browser extension for the template: [https://github.com/SwingTheVine/Wplace-BlueMarble/]

Browser suggestion : Brave // Firefox might have some problems // Mobile should also work but I'm not sure what browsers work best

## Important: If you have unlocked the locked colors, please prioritize placing those for other users. This will help everyone unlock the full palette and contribute more effectively!*


Next, Right click the image of Miku to download it and upload it to the Blue Marble box on Wplace along with these coordinates:

# Please check the QR code from time to time to make sure it's scannable! If it's not working, try fixing it for other people with the image and coordinates below.
# Also there's a image of Teto above Miku but who cares about her,  right? (Image below)
