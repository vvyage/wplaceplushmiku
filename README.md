# wplaceplushmiku
A Project to put Miku on the map!
I made this page to show what I'm trying to make, and I'm looking for people to help out on this

How do I contribute?: To get Miku onto your page and starting drawing, follow the instructions over here to get the template: [https://github.com/SwingTheVine/Wplace-BlueMarble/]
