# A Project to put Miku on the map!
## I made this page to show what I'm trying to paint, and I'm also looking for people to help out on this! Yes, you! Since this would take longer than a month to make alone :/

How do I contribute?
------------------
To get Miku onto your Wplace page and starting painting, follow the instructions over here to get the browser extension for the template: [https://github.com/SwingTheVine/Wplace-BlueMarble/]
Warning: Firefox might be buggy since you might have to refresh the Wplace page everytime you place a pixel. (Might just be a issue on my end)

Next, click on the picture of Miku below this and right click it to download it
