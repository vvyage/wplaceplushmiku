How do I contribute?
------------------------------------
To get Miku onto your Wplace page and starting painting, follow the instructions over here to get the browser extension for the template: [https://github.com/SwingTheVine/Wplace-BlueMarble/]
### Warning: Firefox might be buggy since you might have to refresh the Wplace page everytime you place a pixel. (Might just be a issue on my end) / Browser suggestion : Brave

## Important: If you have unlocked the locked colors, please prioritize placing those for other users. This will help everyone unlock the full palette and contribute more effectively!*

Next, click on the picture of Miku below and right click it to download it and upload it to the Blue Marble box on Wplace with these coordinates: 

1163 / 602 / 943 / 171

# Also there's a image of Teto above Miku but who cares about her right? (Image below)
